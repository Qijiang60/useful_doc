Under Windows:
set proxy settings in cmd when I was in a proxy network as follows:

set http_proxy=http://username:pass@hostname:port

set https_proxy=https://username:pass@hostname:port


unset:
set http_proxy=
set https_proxy=


Under bash:
rom git bash run: $ export HTTPS_PROXY=https://
Then: $ export HTTP_PROXY=https://
